# gorwmem
Package developed in Golang that allows reading and writing processes in the operating system's memory. This is done through read and write operations in the process memory, which can be useful in scenarios such as debugging, malware analysis and reverse engineering.

## Motivation 
motivation created to meet a need to open and read, get the value and rewrite the value in memory, I wanted to replicate something I already did in C++ using the Windows api

## About
It's still an initial idea that only works in a windows environment, but I have some plans for this package
